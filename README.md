# PAWS

  This is a web application built with a Rails API backend and a React/Redux frontend. This web application allows users to signup so they can report pets that have run away from home or pets they have found on the street to their community. Users have the ability to comment on others' posts so the community can help each other find their lost pets or possibly foster stray pets until their family can be found.
